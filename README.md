1. What technologies did you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)?

The tech stack I used was React, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap for its grid system. I decided to use React as my frontend framework because I wanted to gain a refresher from it since it has been a while since I last used React. 

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose?

The biggest challenges I face was properly fitting divs in its section with the grid system and then having it be mobile responsive too. Another challenge was getting the carousel to work correctly.


3. What you enjoyed the most and why?

Although I only used the basic functions of React, I enjoyed working with compenents again because of its reuseable and stackable code which helps to breakdown building a page more easily.
